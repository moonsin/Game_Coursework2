One day, the king’s son rode through a forest and found a tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. After a long time, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:
 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,Let down your hair to me.’ 
He saw that braids of golden hari was let down, and the enchantress climbed up.
 ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune,’ said he.
 The next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:
  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,Let down your hair to me.’
