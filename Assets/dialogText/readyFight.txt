Prince: My best friends, just kill the evil! Let's solve the poor Rapunzel!
Mage: Yes, your highness. I will defeat all the enemies with my magic.
enchantress: Who are you! I will kill you! Join me, my servant.
Cleric: (samall) Well, then let me explain the rules of the game.
Cleric: In one battle, all roles and enemies will follow the order ranked by a random number based on Dexterity. 
Cleric: In each turn, the player can control the role to release ‘Move’ and ‘Attack’ or 'Move' and‘Skill’ once a time. Click ‘Rest’ to finish the role’s turn. 
Cleric: Oh, I almost forget it, each role gains 1 Skill Point after turn finished! This is important.
Cleric: this should be all, good luck, May the light with you.
