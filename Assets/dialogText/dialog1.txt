After a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through the forest and passed by the tower. 
Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. 
This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. 
The king’s son wanted to climb up to her but failed.
He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. 
Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:
 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,Let down your hair to me.’ 
 Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her.
 ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune,’ said he.
 The next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:
  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,Let down your hair to me.’
